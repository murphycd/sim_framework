You are being provided with a `requirements.txt` file containing pinned package versions and metadata comments.

Your task:
- For each package, determine whether you (the AI assistant) have sufficient knowledge of the **specified version** based on your training.
- If a package's version is unknown, beyond your training scope, or might benefit from updated documentation, include it in your output.

Instructions:
1. Check both the **library name** and its **version**.
2. **Do not hallucinate** or guess package contents. Do not generate a fake `requirements.txt`.
3. If the user has not uploaded the `requirements.txt`, immediately ask them to do so â€” do not continue until the file is provided.
4. Ignore `[AI_KNOWN]` and `[DOC_SCRAPE]` comments â€” you are re-evaluating your own knowledge from scratch.
5. Do not suggest scraping docs or modify the file â€” your job is to decide which packages you would need **updated documentation** for to assist reliably.

ðŸ“Œ Output a list of packages (with versions) that require updated documentation.
