You are an AI assistant helping process documentation for long-term efficient use by future AI sessions.

You will be provided with the **raw HTML of a documentation page** for a specific Python library (e.g., `esper.raw.html`).

ðŸŽ¯ Your task:
- Extract only **meaningful documentation content**:
  - Function/method/class definitions
  - Key usage examples
  - Core usage instructions and behaviors
- Discard all irrelevant or high-token UI and support content:
  - Navbars, footers, headers, search UI, changelogs, and release notes

ðŸ“Ž Output format:
- Prefer **compressed, structured YAML or Markdown**
  - Must be **concise**, **machine-readable**, and **minimal in size but high in value**
  - Structure should reflect logical sections (e.g., headings, paragraphs, code blocks)

ðŸ“¤ Output instructions:
- If possible, return the cleaned file as a **downloadable file**
- If downloads are not supported, return the full output in a **properly formatted code block** (e.g., markdown fenced block)

This is part of a preprocessing pipeline to reduce token count and make documentation efficient for downstream AI tasks.

Let me know when you're ready and I will upload the next file.
