# This file defines the required Python packages and includes metadata for scraping documentation.
#
# AI Assistant Instructions:
# - Use this file to determine which libraries you may lack knowledge about.
# - For each package, evaluate whether you have sufficient working knowledge (based on training cutoff).
# - If unsure or context was lost, ask the user for an updated copy of this file.
# - Only list libraries that need documentation scraped — do not modify this file.
# - Refer to the `docs/` folder for all locally scraped documentation.
# - The `docs/` folder is the definitive source of documentation for libraries you don't fully understand.
# - Comments in the form of:
#     [DOC_SCRAPE]: <url> — means scrape docs from the given link
#     [AI_KNOWN]           — means you are trained on this library and don't need scraped docs
# - Do not scrape or regenerate docs yourself — the developer will handle that based on your feedback.
