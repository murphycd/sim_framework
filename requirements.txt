# This file defines the required Python packages for this project.
# 
# Developer Checklist for adding or upgrading requirements:
# 1. If any package is missing a metadata comment, add one:
#      - [AI_KNOWN]           → AI is already trained on this library.
#      - [DOC_SCRAPE]: <url>  → Docs must be scraped from the provided link.
#
# 2. For each [DOC_SCRAPE] entry:
#      - Find a reliable, minimal URL (e.g. main API docs page).
#      - Run: `make scrape-docs` to fetch raw HTML to `docs/raw/`.
#
# 3. For each raw doc file:
#      - Upload it to ChatGPT with prompt from: prompts/docs_process_raw_html.txt
#      - Save AI-compressed output as: `docs/<package>-<version>.yaml`
#
# 4. Validate the setup:
#      - Run: `make validate-project`
#      - Ensures scraped docs exist for all [DOC_SCRAPE] packages.
